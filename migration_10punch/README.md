# Punchcard Migration: 11-Punch to 10-Punch System

This folder contains the migration script and documentation for converting the punchcard system from 11 punches to 10 punches.

## Contents

- `migrate_to_10_punch.py` - Migration script that:
  - Identifies empty punchcards (0 punches used) for $10 refund
  - Removes the last punch from all other cards
  - Truncates all cards to 10 slots
  - Generates a refund report

## Migration Details

- **Date**: August 5, 2025
- **Total cards processed**: 93
- **Empty cards requiring refunds**: 2 ($20 total)
- **Used cards modified**: 91 (last punch removed)

## Important Note

**This folder should be removed from the repository after 2025 to improve code coverage.**

The migration script is a one-time utility that was used to convert the punchcard system. Once the migration is complete and the system has been running on the 10-punch format for a sufficient period, this folder should be deleted to:

1. Reduce repository size
2. Improve code coverage metrics
3. Remove legacy migration code
4. Clean up the codebase

## Refund Information

Two players had empty punchcards and require $10 refunds each:
- Jacques Chirazi (purchased 10/06/2024)
- William M (purchased 08/02/2025)

Refunds should be sent via Venmo (@James-Melrod) or Zelle (jimmymelrod@gmail.com) with the note "Punchcard system migration refund".
