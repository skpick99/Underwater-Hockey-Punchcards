If you did play and haven't paid yet, please take this opportunity to
send payment to Jim Melrod through Venmo (@James-Melrod) or you can pay
in cash at the pool.  You can either pay $10 per overdue session, or send
him $100 for a new punchcard and we'll apply the unpaid sessions to your new card.

Thank you taking care of this for the club.  We appreciate your membership.
