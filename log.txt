ToDo List
----------
code to check for meetup user names beginning with "User " 
	error that LibreOffice/Excel automatically creates by capitalizing "U" which breaks punchcard system
when update punchcards.csv, sort it
occasional maintenance
	move old punchcards (status=prev and last punchdate over 2 months ago) to punchcards_history.csv	
add menu items for 
	change add-new-player to auto search the last 5-10 games
	allow change date by choosing from recent games
	check for game date wrong based on latest signup date
	existing player using new meetup id (check when adding new player)
	allow user to edit the data through software (instead of excel/libreoffice)
	allow two players to share a punchcard via software (instead of excel/libreoffice)
some automated method of data backup
method of sharing data so two operators can switch off running the software
method of sharing old game data (YYYYMMDD.csv files)

Expand push information to include texting
Split the cross reference file (meetup_roster.csv) handling to its own class
For adding a manual punch for user with no punchcard, create a past-due punchcard
If you're updating the next day, it's too easy to download the meetup file to the wrong date
Allow reduced email notifications - only if requested
Rewrite as a web application, appropriate for general use - don't hold your breath


Create short manual
	Installation 
		my hockey directory is D:\hockey\autopay.  
		My Windows download directory is D:\Downloads.  
		install python3, list of imports, sendgrid for emails
		Your meetup name must include both "UNDERWATER" and "HOCKEY" in the title (case insensitive)
	Run 
		warning: don't download too early or you'll get the prior hockey game info from Meetup
		warning: move date if processing game from prior day(s)
		go to hockey directory and type "python CMenu.py"
		describe menu items
	Other
		Data file layouts (*.csv files/keys, libreoffice=tabs only)
			thoughts on improvements
		python files
		how to hand edit files
		errors and how to correct them
		what's not yet implemented

Decide standard way of archiving old game date files (YYYYMMDD.csv files)

Code to pull 3 month old punchcards put in punchcard_history file
	Re-alphabetize the punchcard file at the same time to make it easier to hand edit

ID or Reverse wrong gameday download because too early
ID or Reverse wrong date on gameday download
Get gameday date from datafile, or at least warn about potential error
	No one signs up on day of game would be unusual
	Games not on Friday or Sunday would be unusual

HOWTO
------
Download game day too early - delete files
Download game day to wrong date - delete files
Back out a punch because didn't play
