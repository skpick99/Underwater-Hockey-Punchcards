You can signup to pay for you Underwater Hockey games using our punchcard system.
You pay $100 for 10 games, for a total of 10 game punches on the eCard.

Each time you play a game, the system automatically punches your eCard and sends you an email
showing you each game you've been charged for, along with the number of punches remaining on
the card. The charges originate from the signup on meetup. You can signup for our Meetup at
meetup.com/san-diego-underwater-hockey-meetup/ 
If you signup but don't play, just send an email to sandiegouwh.com letting me know and I'll 
take care of it. The signup on Meetup is how we do punchcards and make teams ahead of time, 
so it is helpful and important to use it.

To get your first punchcard, just send $100 to our treasurer, Jim Melrod and we'll get you setup.
You can use Venmo (@James-Melrod) or Zelle (jimmymelrod@gmail.com) or pay in cash at the pool.

Many email systems will send our messages into your spam folder. To prevent that from happening,
we suggest you create a new entry in your contact list for 'sandiegouwh@gmail.com'.

If you have any questions, call Scott Pickett at 858-205-0696 and he will help you.
Thanks for being a member of our community and have a great day.
