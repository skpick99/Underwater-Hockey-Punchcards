You can purchase your next punchcard at any time by sending ******* $100. You can use
Venmo (@**********) or pay in cash at the pool.

Your new punchcard won't start being used until you've completely finished using
your current punchcard, so you won't lose any punches by signing up now.  It makes
it easier on us to not have to reach out and let you know your old punchcard is used
up. The system just automatically transitions to the new punchcard at the appropriate
time. No extra effort required by anyone."of our community and have a great day.
